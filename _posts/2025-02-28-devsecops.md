As cloud security becomes increasingly important, it presents a challenge to balance efficiency with maintaining a compliant and secure cloud platform. In this post, I'll explain why this is important for cloud-architects and engineers and how you can use the [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) to support a scalable [Zero Trust Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) on the Azure-platform.

Microsoft [mentions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) the following challenge:
>The cloud moves fast, developers move fast, and attackers also move fast. How do you keep up and make sure that your cloud deployments are secure?

#### Regulations: A Changing Landscape
At December 17, 2024 the U.S. government released a [binding operational directive](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-25-01-implementing-secure-practices-cloud-services) mandating that federal agencies maintain a secure configuration baseline within the cloud. This directive aims to raise the bar for cloud security, requiring stricter adherence to cloud-security best practices. In response, _Steve Faehl, Federal Security Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft_ outlined [New Microsoft guidance for the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/19/new-microsoft-guidance-for-the-cisa-zero-trust-maturity-model/).

While these guidelines are more specific, they build upon existing ones like [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) which many organizations already implement for security and compliance. This standard goes beyond securing cloud-environments. In this post, I'll focus specifically on securing Azure-solutions.

#### A Brief History of Cloud Security
As _Mark Simons, Lead Cybersecurity Architect at Microsoft_, [noted in 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/11/11/zero-trust-strategy-what-good-looks-like/), traditional security models rely heavily on a _"Trusted Network"_. As he mentions, this approach involves creating a strong network perimeter where the inside is trusted, and the outside is not. However, as organizations move to the cloud, this network-centric model can become increasingly complex, expensive, and inflexible - especially when applied to dynamic, microservices-based environments like those found in Azure.

These challenges with perimeter-based security have pushed the industry towards [identity-based authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identity-management). In this paradigm, rather than relying on securing the perimeter, it relies on securing and applying Zero Trust to the resources themselves. This has resulted in the development of new [security guidelines and tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/). With this shift, the responsibility for choosing scalable infrastructure components (Azure-resources) and protecting these now lies within the dev-team expected to deliver business value.

#### Tools and challenges

As infrastructure and security responsibilities move into the hands of developers and architects, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the necessary knowledge is available within the team. It highlights the importance of [DevSecOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/operate/security-in-devops) (development, security, and operations). Which is an evolution of traditional [DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/what-is-devops), integrating security practices directly into the development pipeline.

Microsoft Azure provides several cloud-native tools and mechanisms to help achieve this. Including:
-  [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-regulatory-compliance-standards) to assess and monitor the security mechanisms that are in place on your resources
-  [Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) combined with [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to [provide access without secret-management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/migrate-applications-from-secrets).
-  [App Registrations and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals)
-  Resource specific mechanisms like [built-in authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)
-  [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) to enforce certain practices

Leveraging these tools helps to mitigate security risks while maintaining flexibility and scalability.
