As cloud security becomes increasingly important, it presents a challenge to balance efficiency with maintaining a compliant and secure cloud platform. This complexity led me to explore how this balance can be achieved effectively. In this post, Iâ€™ll explain why this is crucial for cloud architects and engineers and how you can use the [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) to support a scalable [Zero Trust Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) within the Azure-platform.

#### Regulations
At December 17, 2024 the U.S. government released a [binding operational directive](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-25-01-implementing-secure-practices-cloud-services) mandating that federal agencies maintain a secure configuration baseline within the cloud. This directive aims to raise the bar for cloud security, requiring stricter adherence to cloud-security best practices. In response, _Steve Faehl, Federal Security Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft_ outlined [New Microsoft guidance for the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/19/new-microsoft-guidance-for-the-cisa-zero-trust-maturity-model/).

While these guidelines are more specific, they build upon existing standards like [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) which many organizations already implement for security and compliance. These guidelines go beyond just securing cloud-environments. In this post, I'll focus specifically on how the Microsoft Identity Platform can be used to design and build a scalable Zero Trust Architecture for Azure-solutions.

#### A Brief History of Cloud Security
As _Mark Simons, Lead Cybersecurity Architect at Microsoft_, [noted in 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/11/11/zero-trust-strategy-what-good-looks-like/), traditional security models relied heavily on a _"Trusted Network" security strategy_. As he mentions, this approach involves creating a strong network perimeter where the inside is trusted, and the outside is not. However, as organizations move to the cloud, this network-centric model is becoming increasingly complex, expensive, and inflexible - especially when applied to dynamic, microservices-based environments like those found in Azure.

These challenges with perimeter-based security have pushed the industry toward [identity-based authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identity-management). In this paradigm, rather than relying on securing the perimeter, it relies on securing the resources themselves. This has resulted in the development of new [security guidelines and tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/introduction). With this shift, the responsibility for choosing scalable infrastructure components (Azure-resources) and protecting these resources now lies with the development-team expected to deliver business value.

#### Tools and challenges

As infrastructure and security responsibilities move into the hands of developers and architects, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the necessary knowledge is available within the team. It highlights the importance of [DevSecOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/devsecops/enable-devsecops-azure-github) (development, security, and operations). Which is an evolution of traditional [DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/what-is-devops), integrating security practices directly into the development pipeline.

Microsoft Azure provides several tools and mechanisms to ensure compliance. Examples include:
-  [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-regulatory-compliance-standards) to assess and monitor the security mechanisms that are in place on your resources
-  [Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) combined with [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to [provide access without secret-management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/migrate-applications-from-secrets).
-  [App Registrations and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals)
-  Resources specific mechanisms like [built-in authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)

 These tools become increasingly important, especially in environments where traditional network perimeters are not in place - such as in a vanilla Azure environment. Leveraging these tools helps to mitigate security risks while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

In a future post I'll show some concrete examples of how these tools and practices can be used.
